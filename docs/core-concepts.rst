Core Concepts
*******************************

In this page you will find a description of the core concepts necessary to move on with implementing a gitops approach for automating Kafka operations.

What is gitops?
-----------

GitOps is a paradigm or a set of practices that empowers developers to perform tasks which typically fall under the purview of IT operations.
GitOps requires us to describe and observe systems with declarative specifications that eventually form the basis of continuous everything.

So with this we bring into the table:

* Autonomy for teams, they can request and fulfil their own ops needs independently.
* A declarative approach, users describe what they need and not how it is implemented, facilitating the solution of problems, keeping detailed implementation abstracted.
* A centralised way to verify and control changes, providing an audit trail to fulfil change management requirements.
* Have a centralised source of truth where the current state of the platform is represented.
