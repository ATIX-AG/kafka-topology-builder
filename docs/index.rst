Welcome to Kafka Topology Builder's documentation!
==================================================

Getting started
-------------------------------


Installation
-----------

To install the Kafka Topology Builder and enable your teams to use a gitops approach when managing Apache Kafka you need:

* A CI/CD server, for example Jenkins, but any other will serve the purpose
* A git repository where the Topology description will be stored
* And for sure a Kafka cluster :-)

See the  :doc:`workflow-setup` section to learn more how to setup the required components to enable the full workflow.

Help?
------------------------------

If case you require any help regarding the usage or development of the Kafka Topology Builder, don't hesitate to contact our `gitter community  <https://gitter.im/kafka-topology-builder/community#>`.
In the future, when there is the request we might as well create a mailing list or other method of communication that help people using this project.
